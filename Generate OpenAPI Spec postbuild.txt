Installed following nuget packages:
Swashbuckle.AspNetCore.Newtonsoft
Swashbuckle.AspNetCore.Newtonsoft

Run following command in terminal:
dotnet tool install --global Swashbuckle.AspNetCore.Cli --version 6.3.1

Copied dotnet-tools.json to .config folder on root of solution as was done in Client Portal API

Also added post build event in csproj for each microservice

<Target Name="PostBuild" AfterTargets="PostBuildEvent">
    <Exec Command="dotnet tool restore" />
    <Exec Command="dotnet swagger tofile --output swagger.json $(OutputPath)\$(AssemblyName).dll v1 " />
  </Target>

Common errors:
Exited with error code 1:Check buildPlatform: 'AnyCPU' and not 'Any CPU'
Exited with error code -5*****: Ensure each endpoint doesn't have an ambiguous http method

proper example might look like:

namespace Something.API.Controllers
{
    [ApiController]
    [Route("[controller]")]
    public class SomethingController : Controller
    {
        [HttpGet]
        public IActionResult Index()
        {
            return View();
        }
    }
}

Notable here is the [HttpGet]
